scQubits documentation
======================

scqubits is an open-source Python library for simulating superconducting qubits.


Getting Started
***************

After :ref:`Installation` of qoc, check out the




Overview
********

The package provides convenient ways to obtain energy spectra of common superconducting qubits, to plot their energy
levels as a function of external parameters, to calculate matrix elements and predict coherence times etc. scqubits
further offers an interface to QuTiP, making it easy to work with composite Hilbert spaces consisting of multiple
coupled superconducting qubits and harmonic modes.

scqubits performs numerics utilizing Numpy and Scipy; plotting capabilities rely on Matplotlib.
